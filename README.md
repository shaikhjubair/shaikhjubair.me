Welcome to the source code of my personal portfolio website. This project showcases my skills as an **AI Engineer** and **Data Scientist**, featuring a unique **"Serverless" Blog system** powered by the GitHub API.

🌐 **Live Website:** [shaikhjubair.me](https://shaikhjubair.me)

## 🚀 Key Features

* **⚡ Serverless Blog Engine:** The blog section is fully dynamic but uses **no database**. Instead, it fetches content from **GitHub Issues** via the REST API.
    * *How it works:* I write posts as GitHub Issues -> Tag them as `published` -> The site fetches and renders them using Markdown.
* **🎨 Modern UI/UX:** Designed with a neon/dark theme suitable for a developer portfolio.
* **📱 Fully Responsive:** Optimized for Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop.
* **📈 Integrated Analytics:** Real-time visitor tracking with Google Analytics 4.
* **✉️ Contact Form:** Functional contact form powered by Formspree.
